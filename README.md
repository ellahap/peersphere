# PeerSphere

This is the repository for our semester-long project for UIUC's [CS 222: Software Design Lab](https://cs222-uiuc.pages.dev/).

Many students struggle to find adequate academic support for their classes although professors provide resources. Our project aims to create a collaborative interface where students can share course resources and coordinate study sessions to facilitate peer-to-peer learning.
