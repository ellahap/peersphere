# Introduction
## What is PeerSphere?

PeerSphere is your collaborative campus hub ‚Äî a peer-to-peer learning platform where students can share resources (notes, slides, etc.), ask and answer questions, and plan study sessions together.  You can access our site [here](https://peersphere-i9nx.onrender.com/).

Below is a walk-through of our site, and its core features.

Our platform constructs a centralized space in which students can:

1. Create or join study groups
2. Share and upload course materials (PDFs, slides, flashcards, etc.)
3. View and upvote/downvote material
4. Post availability and organize study sessions
5. Schedule sessions with Google Calendar
6. Access Q&A threads for class-specific discussion
